* Radius v3.0 Upgrade Notice: Radius was recoded from the ground up to fit the current framework of Okay Themes. Several major changes in the architecture, features and settings have taken place in this update. Because of this, if you are upgrading from version 2.3, you will have to set up the theme again, as if it were a new theme. While this is kind of a bummer, the upside is you get this huge and awesome update for free. Radius 3.0 has really slick galleries, a better responsive layout, more white space, more attention to detail, and it's much easier to setup and maintain. See the install video and instructions (http://array.is/articles/radius/) to get your theme updated and setup on Radius 3.0.
* A Note About Shortcodes - The shortcodes that came with Radius originally have been removed in version 3.0. This was for several reasons, but mostly because they are more trouble than they're worth for users. They will only be supported in version 2.3 and lower. If you still require the use of shortcodes, you can checkout one of the many shortcode plugins in the repository. Shortcodes Ultimate is a popular one (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/shortcodes-ultimate/).

= 3.0 - 5/6/13 =
* Recoded entire theme to sit on the new Okay Themes framework.
* Removed Options Framework plugin in favor of the WordPress Theme Customizer. Settings are now handled in Appearance → Customize.
* Separated posts and portfolio items. Portfolio items now use a custom post type, which is provided by the Okay Toolkit Plugin.
* Added support for new, awesome galleries. Use the new WordPress 3.5 media manager to create galleries, rearrange them, and display them in your portfolio items.
* Reworked the responsive media queries to accomodate more devices. The theme is now 100% flexible, versus the fixed breakpoints it was using before.
* Twitter widget and social media icons have been moved to the Okay Toolkit plugin. Toolkit also provides several other widgets.
* Removed shortcode functionality from the theme and moved them into a plugin. See note above.
* Tons of little changes here and there. Check out the demo to see the theme in action, and be sure to check out the install video and instructions (http://array.is/articles/radius/) which will walk you through setting up Radius v3.0.
